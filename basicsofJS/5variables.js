// they staore data in specific memory locations 

// to declare variable we use var,let ,or const keywords

// the variable that chage at different time we use we use 'let'

// syntax to assign a variable 

// let nameOfVariable = value

// Declaring different variables of different data types
let firstName = 'SHAHRUKH'   // first name of a person
let lastName = 'KHAN'    // last name of a person
let country = 'INDIA'    // country
let age = 58        // age in years
let isMarried = true

console.log(firstName, lastName, country, age, isMarried)


// And const is used data which doesnot change (fixed)
//ex: gravity ,boiling point 

const gravity= 9.81 
const boilingPoint = 100

console.log(gravity,boilingPoint);

// single line representation of the variables 

let nameF = 'SRK', job = 'Actor', netWorth = '700cr' 
console.log(nameF, job, netWorth)
