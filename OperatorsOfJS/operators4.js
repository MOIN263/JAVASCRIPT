// string operators 

// string concatenation

/*When working with JavaScript strings sometimes you need to join two or more strings together into a single string. Joining multiple strings together is known as concatenation.

The concatenation operator

The concatenation operator (+) concatenates two or more string values together and return another string which is the union of the two operand strings.

The shorthand assignment operator += can also be used to concatenate strings.*/

// + concatenation
let string1 = 'smufcodes'
let string2 = '@gmail.com'
console.log(string1+string2)

// += concatenation

console.log(string1+=' is the user name entered')

// += operator updates the value
